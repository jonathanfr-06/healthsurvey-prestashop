## What's next

I would like to attach the survey to an event during the checkout, just before the customer confirm all information. Unfortunately, despite all my efforts, I did not manage to find the right hook yet or the good method.

## Thanks

Thanks for trying this module, if you have any questions related to the code, feel free to contact me.
